        Background Image - Repeat Horizontally or Vertically
        By default, the background-image property repeats an image both horizontally and vertically.

        Some images should be repeated only horizontally or vertically, or they will look strange,
    </p>

    <pre>
        In the example above, the background image is shown in the same place as the text. We want to change the position of the image, so that it does not disturb the text too much.
The position of the image is specified by the background-position property:
</pre>

    <h2>CSS background-color example!</h2>
    <div>
        This is a text inside a div element.
        <p>This paragraph has its own background color.</p>
        We are still in the div element.
